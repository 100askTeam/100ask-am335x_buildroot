Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

The documentation can be found in docs/manual. You can generate a text
document with 'make manual-text' and read output/docs/manual/manual.text.
Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

# 100sk_am335x board

 1) run 'make 100ask_am335x_defconfig'
 2) run 'make  -jN' N represents the number of CPU cores
 3) run 'make menuconfig '
 4) wait while it compiles
 5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images
